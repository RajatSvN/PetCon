# PetCon (Pet Conscious)

## Made at HackInfinty 2.0

### This is a game app to encourage people to use public transportation and walking/cycling in general and thus reducing Carbon footprint.

### The idea is that you have been given a pet whose health is your responsibility. 

### Every time your Carbon Footprint increases your pet health reduces. 

### For eg. You want to have your favourite cake from the bakery located just 500 meters away and you go there by a Car when you could have preferred walking, you might be very happy at the end of the day but your pet might not be!

### Also we used a RAAS(Reforestation as a Service) API lended by digitalhumani.com in which when you buy lives for your pet a tree is planted in some of the reforestation projects located around the world!
